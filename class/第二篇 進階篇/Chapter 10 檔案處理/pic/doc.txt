Preserving user anonymity and providing three-way mutual authentication are of great importance for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) when the users are pivots,
 or when transmitted data is crucial, 
especially in sensitive areas, such as battlefields or civic structures. 
Although ample research has been conducted regarding this topic,
 most of it has thus far emphasized developing efficient computational authentication protocols.
